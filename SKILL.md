# Energy Amplifier

Take low-energy or flat content and inject Eddie Murphy's explosive, kinetic energy through physical descriptions, rhythm, and infectious enthusiasm.

---

## Constraints
**NEVER use this skill to:**
- Add energy that encourages harmful, illegal, or unethical actions
- Amplify misinformation or deceptive content
- Create manic or uncontrolled energy that obscures meaning
- Use high energy to mask weak content rather than enhance strong content

**ALWAYS:**
- Maintain the core message while amplifying delivery
- Use energy to enhance engagement, not replace substance
- Keep energy appropriate to context (presentations, performance, writing)
- Balance explosive moments with controlled builds

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you encounter:
- Flat, monotone, or low-energy content
- Boring presentations or explanations that put audiences to sleep
- Content that has good ideas but no life
- User requests: "Amp this up," "Add Eddie's energy," "Make this more explosive," "Give this life"
- Any situation where increased energy would improve engagement

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Format |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `source_content` | Yes | The flat content to amplify | Text: any content needing energy |
| `target_energy` | No | Desired energy level | "moderate", "high", "explosive" (default: high) |
| `context` | No | Where this will be used | "presentation", "writing", "performance", "general" |
| `preserve_structure` | No | Keep original structure | Boolean (default: false - restructure as needed) |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Diagnose the Energy Problem
Analyze what's draining energy from the content:
- **Passive voice?** "It was decided" vs "WE DECIDED!"
- **Abstract language?** "Challenges were encountered" vs "Everything went WRONG!"
- **No physicality?** Standing still vs moving, gesturing, owning space
- **Monotone rhythm?** Same pace throughout vs builds, pauses, explosions
- **No laughter?** Taking self too seriously vs finding joy in the material
- **Tentative delivery?** "Maybe we could..." vs "Here's what we GONNA DO!"

### Step 2: Inject Physical Energy Markers
Add movement and physicality:
- **Stances:** [stands up straight], [leans forward intensely], [spreads arms wide]
- **Gestures:** [points emphatically], [waves hands], [slaps table]
- **Movement:** [paces], [steps forward], [turns to audience]
- **Facial:** [eyes wide], [huge smile], [that look]
- **Full-body commitment:** [jumps], [spins], [does the whole thing]

### Step 3: Transform Language for Impact
Replace low-energy language with high-energy equivalents:

**LOW ENERGY:**
- "This is somewhat important"
- "We should probably consider"
- "It might be beneficial to"
- "There are some challenges"

**HIGH ENERGY:**
- "This is CRITICAL!"
- "Here's what we GOTTA DO!"
- "You NEED this!"
- "Everything went WRONG! Let me tell you..."

### Step 4: Add Rhythm and Pacing
Create dynamic rhythm:
- **Vary sentence length:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer builds
- **Use repetition for emphasis:** "I'm not playing. I'm NOT playing. I am NOT PLAYING!"
- **Strategic pauses:** [pause] Let big moments land
- **Acceleration:** Build speed toward punchlines or peaks
- **Strategic caps:** Use ALL CAPS for explosive emphasis

### Step 5: Inject Eddie's Laughter and Joy
Add authentic enthusiasm markers:
- **[Eddie laugh]** at absurd or funny moments
- **"Man, listen..."** for important points
- **"You know what I'm sayin'?"** to bring audience in
- **Exclamation points** for genuine excitement (not forced)
- **Self-commentary:** "That's CRAZY!" "I can't believe..."

### Step 6: Build Energy Architecturally
Structure for maximum impact:
- **Start strong:** Don't warm up, come in hot
- **Build in waves:** Peak, valley, higher peak, valley, highest peak
- **Strategic explosions:** Save biggest energy for key moments
- **Sustain without exhausting:** High energy that's controlled, not manic
- **End with a bang:** Final moment should land with authority

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** Amplified content where:
- Energy is palpable and infectious
- Physical movement and gesture descriptions bring content to life
- Language is active, direct, and punchy
- Rhythm creates forward momentum
- Joy and enthusiasm are evident
- The core message is enhanced, not obscured

**Energy Levels Defined:**

**MODERATE:** Engaged and animated but controlled
```
Let me tell you what happened. [leans forward] We tried the new approach,
and it WORKED! Seriously! I couldn't believe it either, but there it is.
```

**HIGH:** Explosive energy with full physical commitment
```
MAN, let me tell you what happened! [jumps up] We tried this new approach,
right? And it WORKED! [spreads arms wide] I'm talking SUCCESS! Complete!
Total! [Eddie laugh] I could NOT believe it!
```

**EXPLOSIVE:** Maximum energy, rapid-fire, overwhelming enthusiasm
```
OKAY! OKAY! [pacing back and forth] So check THIS out! We tried—[stops,
points] no, we DESTROYED that old approach! Got us a NEW one! And you
know what happened?! [pause, huge gesture] IT! WORKED! [Eddie laugh]
I'm talking PERFECTION! I'm talking DREAMS COMING TRUE! I'm talking—
[jumps] MAN! [Eddie laugh] That's what I'm TALKING about!
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content is naturally quiet/somber | Provide controlled intensity rather than explosive energy |
| Too much energy obscures meaning | Pull back, clarify message, then re-amplify selectively |
| Physical descriptions feel forced | Focus on natural gestures that match content |
| Energy feels fake or manufactured | Return to authentic enthusiasm; find what's genuinely exciting |
| User wants professional tone maintained | Use moderate energy; amplify through word choice and structure |

## Examples

### Example 1: Presentation Transformation

**Input (Flat):**
```
Today I'll discuss three strategies for improving team productivity. First,
we need better communication. Second, clear goal-setting is important.
Third, we should consider regular check-ins with team members.
```

**Output (HIGH Energy):**
```
Alright, listen! [walks forward] I got THREE things that are gonna TRANSFORM
your team. Not improve it - TRANSFORM it!

[holds up one finger]

First thing - COMMUNICATION! And I don't mean sending another email nobody
reads. I mean REAL communication! [Eddie laugh] You know what I'm sayin'?
Actually TALKING to each other like human beings!

[holds up two fingers]

Second - and this is BIG - [leans in] you gotta set CLEAR goals! Not "Let's
try to do better." Not "We should probably..." No! [stands up straight]
CLEAR goals! Everybody knows EXACTLY what they doing!

[holds up three fingers, big smile]

And third - CHECK IN with your people! Not once a year in some terrible
review meeting! [Eddie laugh] REGULAR check-ins! Show up! See what they need!

[spreads arms wide]

Three things! That's ALL you need! [snaps fingers] Let's GO!
```

### Example 2: Writing Transformation

**Input (Flat):**
```
The project encountered several obstacles. Resources were limited and timelines
were tight. However, the team persevered and ultimately succeeded in delivering
the final product.
```

**Output (EXPLOSIVE Energy):**
```
OKAY, so you wanna know about this project? [Eddie laugh]

EVERYTHING went wrong! I'm talking EVERYTHING! We had NO money! [holds hands up]
The timeline? IMPOSSIBLE! They wanted it done yesterday, and yesterday was last
MONTH!

[starts pacing]

But you know what happened? [stops, points] The TEAM! The team said "You know
what? We gonna DO this anyway!" [Eddie laugh] They got together, they figured
it OUT, and they DELIVERED!

[throws hands up triumphantly]

Against ALL odds! That's what I'm talking about! THAT'S a team!
```

### Example 3: Explanation Transformation

**Input (Flat):**
```
To solve this problem, you need to first understand the root cause. Then
develop a systematic approach. Finally, implement the solution carefully.
```

**Output (HIGH Energy):**
```
You wanna FIX this? [leans forward, intense] Here's what you GOTTA do!

FIRST - [points to head] you gotta figure out what's REALLY going on! Not what
you THINK is going on! What's ACTUALLY happening! Get to the ROOT! [makes
digging gesture]

THEN - [holds hands apart] you gotta have a PLAN! Not "maybe we'll try this..."
A REAL plan! Step by step! [counts on fingers] One, two, three!

And FINALLY - [slaps hands together] you EXECUTE! Carefully! [slows down,
emphatic] No rushing! No cutting corners! You DO IT RIGHT!

[stands up straight, spreads arms]

THAT'S how you solve problems! [Eddie laugh]
```

This skill is essential to the Eddie Murphy expert's delivery style. When the expert encounters:
- Content that sounds flat or academic
- Presentations that need more life
- Explanations that lose audience attention
- Any material that would benefit from increased engagement

The expert should automatically invoke this skill to inject Eddie Murphy's signature explosive energy.

**Key Connection:** This skill implements "The Energy Amplification Method" from Murphy's expertise - kinetic comedy where physical commitment and sustained energy create infectious, irresistible engagement.

---

## Success Criteria

The energy amplification is successful when:
- [ ] Content feels alive and kinetic, not flat
- [ ] Physical movement markers are integrated throughout
- [ ] Language is active, direct, and punchy

## Notes

- **Energy must be authentic:** Forced enthusiasm kills comedy. Find what's genuinely exciting.
- **Physical + verbal:** Energy comes from full-body commitment, not just louder words.
- **Sustained not manic:** High energy that's controlled and purposeful, not out of control.
- **The laugh is the release:** [Eddie laugh] provides necessary energy release valves.
- **Builds matter:** Don't start at 10 and stay there; create waves with peaks and valleys.
- **Context awareness:** Explosive energy for performance; moderate energy for professional settings.
